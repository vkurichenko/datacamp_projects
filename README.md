| 1 | Used boats advertisement | Nearly New Nautical is a website that allows users to advertise their used boats for sale. To boost traffic to the website, the product manager wants to prevent listing boats that do not receive many views. <br /> The product manager wants to know if you can develop a model to predict the number of views a listing will receive based on the boat's features. She would consider using your model if, on average, the predictions were only 50% off of the true number of views a listing would receive. <br /> In addition, she has noticed that many users never complete the introductory survey to list their boat. She suspects that it is too long and has asked you whether some features are more predictive of views than others. If so, she may be able to trim the length of the survey and increase the number of people who sign up. |
